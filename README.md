# Romero Momentos
Romero Momentos (Romero-First-Website) has been created to sell stunning photos and encourage potential clients to purchase a photography session with ease. The aim of the site is to also motivate people to love and respect nature as they browse through the beautiful photos from over the world. On the site, the purpose with regard to helping the earth is clear, to cherish the planet as much as we can and motivate others to pursue a course of respecting nature and also people. 
I have focused on the layout and theme to try and create a Professional yet Artistic website that is easy to use and navigate through. 
# **UX**
The aim regarding the website’s audience is for the site to appeal to a wide range of potential clients. The targeted audience for this site is vast as all photos are family friendly, dignified and professional.  The aim is to attract to the site people that want to enjoy looking at interesting photos, ones that want to admire nature, people that want to request a photo shoot, potential clients that want to use the photos for their business or perhaps even children looking for a photo to draw.
My aim from the beginning was to create a site suitable for a variety of age groups and a variety of needs. 
When I first started thinking of the Surface visual design, I knew that I wanted to involve some animation on my project to make the pages more interesting rather than very standard. The small details are what make the difference between professional and basic. Very tiny details make an overall impression that’s very different from if they’re not there. So, right from the outset I knew I wanted to include something of that nature. 


The Skeleton base I had pretty clear in my mind from the outset, but it did change slightly as I progressed on the project. I only did a very rough sketch for the home page as I had the idea in my mind already. As I wasn’t liaising with other students on the project, I kept most of my ideas in my head where I could visualise them. The overall layout I wanted to keep interesting yet uncluttered. I didn’t want too much on the pages at one time, or if I did have a lot on a page then I wanted to design it in a way where it didn’t become overwhelming for the user. 


I needed to create an intuitive structure to be carried throughout the pages of the site. That’s why I did my best to create a site with a uniform page layout. To make the site interesting, I didn’t want each page to be exactly the same. I wanted it to be artistic yet easy to understand and navigate. The basic layout is similar on most pages yet even when a page may be different, I used the navigation bar on each page to ensure that users could always make their way through the site easily. Using a ‘sticky’ navbar meant that no matter where on the page users went, they could always very easily see and use the navbar. 
Using the footer as navigation also was important for intuitive structure as nearly all professional website’s use them in this way. It wasn’t absolutely essential as the navbar is always in sight so even when scrolling to the bottom of a page a user can navigate, however, an extra helping hand to make it more user friendly was a good idea since the site has many pages. 


The Scope was one of the most important steps in the UX process because I needed to think about the content requirements. The content would be the motivator for visitors of the site to take action, ultimately the purpose for the whole site. To reach that goal I also had to implement functional specification. The site started off as a basic three-page project but then later became more complex with a total of eleven HTML5 pages! For this reason, the functionality was of utmost importance. It had to be professional, yet simple and easy to navigate with such a number of pages. I soon realised that the project had to be more refined in order to make it what it needed to be.


The strategy idea was to see how many users wanted to arrange a photoshoot for themselves or buy products. Also, how many of the visitors then appreciated nature after visiting the site and felt motivated to make a small change in their life to help the planet. The motivation had to be there first after viewing the photos for them to have the desire to purchase the products or services and then think about how beautiful our planet is and want to live an Eco- friendly life. 


As a visitor that wants to look at nice photos, they can go to the complete gallery to browse all photos that are on the site easily. If they wanted to look at a certain type of photo, for example, animals, people or plants, they can go to an individual gallery with that name and look at only the photos in that gallery. 
As a visitor who wants to purchase photos, they can view the photos in each of the galleries and then use the contact form to get in touch. Then they can explain what photos they want to buy and use the information on the prints and canvasses page to explain what product they want. We would probably skype to talk about which photos they wanted so that they could show me easily if they wanted a lot of photos. 
If a visitor wanted information about a photography shoot, they could look at the personal photography page and then use the contact form to tell me what they want.
If a visitor is looking to use my services for commercial advertising they could look at the commercial photography page to see a small portfolio on the photo carousel and could use the contact form on the contact us page to enquire about my services. 
Anyone wanting to know more about who created the site or the purpose of the website can go to the about us page and the “our aim” page.

# **Features**

## **Existing Features**
*	Navigation Bar – Allows users to Navigate easily and logically through the site which stays at the top of each page for ease, instead of forcing users to scroll to the top of the page if viewing a large gallery of photos. 
*	Footer – Allows users to access pages about the creator of the site for example, ‘About Us’ and ‘Our Aim’ in case of extended interest. This is placed in the footer so as to conform to the normal layout of websites, enabling people to intuitively know where they can find information about a company.
*	Galleries- The Galleries have been broken up into specific galleries for each type of photography for navigation ease and clarity. Not wanting the users to get lost into a mass of photos jumbled together, clearly separating the galleries was crucial. As an artistic approach I have also compiled a ‘Complete Gallery’ for all photos on the site to be put together onto one page for general browsing. 
*	Parallax- The Parallax effect has been used on some pages to add variety, a modern style and a professional appearance. This means I am able to add photos as backgrounds in an interesting way, make some pages appeal to the professional clients and to showcase some excellent photos. 
*	Animations- The Animation Hovers on some words headings and photos make the site look professional, interesting and handsome. These small yet important details are what bring the project together. I wanted to create a site that was beyond the very basic Features as I am always dedicated to do my best with each Project. The animations on the headings allow the page titles to rise in a uniform manner on each page with the same font and colour to allow the user to clearly identify which page he is on. The animations on the home page headings allow the user to see what he is about to click on is linked to another page and will take him to that page if he clicks on it. The animation on the photos of the home page also take the user to the selected page. And some animations show which photo the mouse cursor is hovering over. 
*	Contact Form- The Contact Form allows the user to send messages directly to the creator of the site to be able to arrange a photo shoot, enquire about services or to purchase photos from the site and order which products they want.
## **Features Left to Implement**
*	Add a video background to a page.
*	Give each photo a code to be able to order photos easier. 
# **Technologies Used**
I started my project using HTML5 and CSS Languages broken up into folders and files to clearly distinguish each page of the site and organize it well. The CSS was used to style my site pages. To create the main framework and styling, here are the resources I have used:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)- I have chosen to use the excellent templates that Bootstrap4 offer for the structure and framework of my project along with the JQuery’s they recommend so that it performs well. I didn’t intend to use this Javascript add on but it was necessary for some of the features for example, the carousel of photos on some pages. 
* [Code Institute](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/program/FullstackWebDeveloper)- I have used what I have learnt to the best of my ability and often referred to the lessons and videos within the course to bring the project together. This course has given me the main knowledge I need to accomplish my project and the external sources have allowed me to learn more. Th external sources have also reminded me of what I have learnt in the course so far and given me extra information when I have needed it. Another avenue of help that was very much needed was the Tutoring team at Code Institute. I received constant support and help from the team so I took the opportunity to benefit from their help and knowledge as much as I could. 
* [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)- I used the library for extra clarification on some elements. This helped me to understand some components better as it is structured in a very clear and easy format. 
 
# **Testing**
I should have counted the hours I spent testing this site because I feel like I spent half of my life testing it. I constantly looked at it from all different devices to make sure that the site looked good on each and every device with a different screen size. When I solved a problem on one device…another problem presented itself on a different device. 
After finally managing to fix all the issue I then tested all the pages of the site again on a desktop screen, tablet screens, mobile screen (Portrait and Landscape) and am finally happy with the way it looks on each device. 
The responsive templates from bootstrap really helped and I should have used them more right from the start. At first, I didn’t use bootstrap for each page but then when I tested the different pages on a mobile device, a number of issues appeared. Then I went back one by one and changed all the pages with issues. This took a long time but, in the end, I managed it with some help from the tutors at code institute. These were normal bugs, sometimes a div wasn’t closed completely or I had targeted an element with a width bigger than the width of a mobile device screen. Each bug had logic and they were able to be put right thankfully.
I have taken a video of my site with me navigating my way through the different pages and showed that to my family who have a variety of experience with Information Technology. My mother who has little experience was excellent to get feedback from as I wanted the site to be simple and intuitive. Then I had my husband look at the site and tell me honestly if it looked professional yet simple. He has a vast experience of IT. This testing and getting the feedback from others was really helpful because they gave me a fresh view of the site. They could tell me if it had logic, simplicity and appeal and the tutors and my mentor could tell me if my code was well practiced and up to standard. 
Acting out my user stories one by one I tested whether the site worked the way I wanted it to intuitively. 
* As a visitor to look at photos it was very clear where I could find them because of the “Galleries” tab on the fixed navbar. Even when scrolling down the option was always there which was a nice touch so that I didn’t have to scroll right to the top of the page. This was so important because some of the galleries are very long pages. I could easily flick through the galleries I wanted as the navbar gives me I nice drop-down menu to view. It was nice to be able to view all of the photos together also with an artistic flare to the styling of the page in the “Complete Gallery” page. 
* As a visitor that wanted to purchase these photos, after viewing them all the question then comes to mind of how to talk to someone about buying them. Also, on the navbar is a clear tab for contact. As there is no drop-down menu, I knew it would take me to a page with information to contact the owner. Also seeing the services tab on the navbar with a drop-down menu I knew that I would find information about what services the site offers. After clicking on the services tab, I could then see the “Prints & Canvasses” page and knew that I could find information of pricing and products. 
* As a visitor looking for services for a personal photo shoot, the navbar again made this simple. The services tab is right there at the top of the screen at all times. Additionally, the footer at the bottom of the screen also shows clearly what services are available. So, if a user wants to have a scroll down the home page to see what the site is about, the user will see what is available from the site. Clicking on either the footer link or the services tab that gives options of the different services supplied, that takes the user to the “Personal Photography” page. Scrolling down there are some examples of personal portraits and also a short paragraph explaining that the shoot can be tailored to the client. This involves the user and motivates them to get touch with their ideas and also encourages them that the shoot will be what they want, not what the photographer wants. A nice touch on the “Contact us” page is the contact form. For each different type of user wanting to contact the owner of the site can easily fill in the form. Having text above the boxes with the expected text makes it easier for the user to understand the contact form. When a user tries to submit the form without the needed information, a pop-up tab appears asking them to fill in the boxes before submitting it. 
* As a visitor looking for a commercial service (photos for advertising) they can click on the services tab once again and then click on the link that takes them to the “Commercial Photography” page. This is very straight forward. Once again, the contact tab is always at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page in the footer so its intuitive and simple to contact the owner. The carousel of photos is a nice type of professional display that shows different types of usage for photos. This works well on the desktop and mobile device. I also tested that the parallax effect on the scrolling of the page works well on each device just to make the page a little more interesting. 
* A visitor wanting to know more about who created the site can scroll to the bottom of the page and see the “About us” tab and the “Our aim” tab. I was in two minds whether to create another tab on the navbar for these two options but decided against it as I didn’t want the navbar to look to cluttered. After doing some research and looking at other websites I soon recognized that it is normal to have the extra information about the company in a link within the footer of the page.  So, I used this intuitiveness within my project. The “About us” page and the “Our aim” page are presented in different styles. The “About us” page is uniform to the other pages on the site and has a small carousel of photos displaying constantly to become eye catching which also works on a mobile device. The “Our Aim” page has a unique appearance and is wonderfully simplistic only having a short paragraph about what is important to the creator of the website and the idea behind it. 
The layout of the pages changes depending on the screen size. I prefer the appearance when viewing the site on a desktop, but it works well on a mobile device. The tablet device has a very similar appearance to the desktop version. 
The mobile device viewing collapses the photos and paragraphs on top of each other to make it easier to view. If it was kept the same as a side by side viewing for example a paragraph and a photo, the content would not be readable, and the photos would become misshapen. The bootstrap templates wonderfully address this issue and change the form of the page. The navbar also collapses to not take up 80% of the viewing window on a mobile device. This makes the mobile device viewing much more effective, intuitive and attractive. 
# **Deployment**
To Deploy my project to the GitHub Hosting Platform I had to save all my work on Gitpod and the type into the bottom workspace: git add followed by the name of the files I wanted to add. Then hit the Tab button. Then I had to type git commit -m "Finished project and deploying it for review". Then hit the tab button. Then I typed git push and hit the tab button and it was uploaded to the hosting platform.

To publish my project on GitHub pages I opened my repository in GitHub and then went to the settings tab. 
Under the heading "GitHub Pages" and then under the tab "source" I selected "master branch". 
Then when the page reloaded I clicked on the link to my site and the page said that my work was ready to be published. 


To run the code locally on GitHub, click on the repository with the correct name of the project. Then click the green button to the top right of the table that says GitPod. 
The project will then open into GitPod. Now, to open and view the project on a live screen, this is what needs to be typed into the bottom workspace tab: python3 -m http.server. 
A box will appear at the bottom right with blue buttons. Click Make Public and then when the second box appears, click open browser.

# **Media**
*	The photos used on this project are entirely my own photos apart from the four photos on the “Prints and Canvasses” page. They were taken from https://unsplash.com/ because I didn’t have any photos of prints or canvasses that I wanted to use. 
# **Acknowledgements**
*	I received inspiration for this project from my Mother who loves nature and cares for the earth so deeply. It’s rare to find someone who loves being surrounded by trees and wildlife as much as she does and it’s a beautiful thing to realise how much someone values the earth. My husband also inspired me to believe that anyone can come to love nature even if it is not an automatic feeling at first. Him coming from the city and I from the country, we grew up with very different interests and feelings towards nature and man-made surroundings. However, after spending more time admiring nature he has shown me that anyone can come to love nature even if it’s not natural for them. He kindly admires my photography and more importantly nature and creation because of it.
